# üè• Hospital Admissions & Patient Flow Database

## üìñ Project Overview
This project presents a SQL Server relational database built to model hospital admissions and patient flow management. It demonstrates the full cycle of database design and implementation, including:

Schema design and normalization to ensure data integrity, Advanced SQL queries (joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions) for analysis and reporting, Stored procedures for automated operations such as patient admissions and discharge updates, Triggers to enforce business rules and maintain consistency in healthcare records. The project showcases how structured SQL solutions can improve operational efficiency, patient tracking, and data-driven decision-making in a healthcare context  

The project models key entities:
- Patients  
- Doctors  
- Wards  
- Admissions  
- Medications  
- Test Results  

It includes **sample synthetic data** and showcases **analytics queries** relevant to healthcare (e.g., bed occupancy, readmission risk, length of stay, busiest doctors).

How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/joseph6699/sql-hospital-admissions.git
cd sql-hospital-admissions


Run the scripts in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) in this order:

schema.sql
sample_data.sql
queries.sql
procedures_triggers.sql

Explore the queries and stored procedures:

-- Example: Get busiest doctors
EXEC healthcare_admissions.GetWardOccupancy @WardID = 1;

-- Example: Check patient readmission risk
EXEC healthcare_admissions.GetPatientReadmissionRisk @PatientID = 1;

üîç Example Insights
Average length of stay per ward
Readmission rates per patient
Top 3 busiest doctors
Rolling 7-day admission trends
Real-time ward occupancy vs. capacity
